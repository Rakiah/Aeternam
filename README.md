## Synopsis

Started when i was 15 y/o this is my first big project, there is a huge code database of more than 10 000 lines of codes.
it took me probably 6 long months of intense working to get to that point, i learned so much during the developpement of this project that i had to put it on my bitbucket account even though the code is now seriously outdated and probably bad designed.
I stopped working on this project when i was 17 y/o.
